# Voice-Based-Email-System
The current email system is not useful for
visually impaired people. So in this project, we present
an email system based on voice commands for visually
challenged people. Anyone can use a voice-based email
system to send and receive messages without using the
keyboard. This would be beneficial for blind people as
well as it simply saves time.
